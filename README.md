## 🛰️ About the Project
**SpaceTour** is an innovative mobile demo built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the challenge
> **Commercializing Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**

Our goal is to **make space accessible to everyone** through **VR and AR technology**.  
Instead of physically flying to orbit, users can experience the view of Earth **live from satellites**, in **360° virtual reality** — right from their smartphones.

This project demonstrates how **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** can be commercialized responsibly for education, tourism, and global collaboration.
